The concept utilizes a secondary circuit where a low-pass filtered value of the load pressure is generated and fed back to the compensator of the flow supply valve. The novel concept has been investigated theoretically and experimentally. A linear model has been developed to verify the improved stability conditions. The novel concept has been implemented on a single boom actuated by a cylinder. The results show that the pressure oscillations in an otherwise unstable system can be suppressed with the novel concept. This happens without any compromise on the load independence of the flow supply but with some limitations on response time.",https://journals.riverpublishers.com/index.php/IJFP/article/view/166,"['Oscillations', 'counterbalance valve', 'pressure compensated valve', 'instabilities in hydraulic systems', 'loadholding application']"

While the theoretical framework has been established, robust experimental validation of check valve models is lacking. When present, validation methods typically rely on measurements of pressure differential or flow rates, from which check valve dynamics are inferred. In this paper, a lumped parameter model is constructed for a disc style check valve used to control the inlet and outlet flow of a piston pump. Pressure, spring, contact, stiction, and flow forces are investigated to determine which have a significant effect on the check valve dynamics. An experimental pump circuit is constructed and an acrylic sight glass is installed on the check valve manifolds. A method of directly measuring the check valve position during operation using a Laser Triangulation Sensor (LTS) is developed by applying Snell’s law to the air-acrylic and acrylic-oil interfaces and calculating laser refraction to obtain a relationship between valve position and LTS voltage output. Modelled valve position and flow rates are compared to experimental data for three sets of operating conditions – baseline, high speed, and high pressure. In all three cases, modelled inlet and delivery valve displacement closely agree with experimental measurements. Error between predicted and measured flow rates is less than 3% for all cases.",https://journals.riverpublishers.com/index.php/IJFP/article/view/173,"['Hydraulic valve', 'check valve', 'laser triangulation', 'stiction', 'flow forces', 'experimental validation']"

The valve and cylinder configuration and the dimensioning of these systems is dependent on the requested transient response and the load profile. One of the primary factors in this regards is the selection of an asymmetric or symmetric cylinder, considering issues such as the area available for installation and the asymmetry of the external loading. According to the classical literature, the valve control orifice areas must be matched with the cylinder areas to ensure balanced pressure variation in the cylinder chambers. Moreover, considering that several real applications use non-matched components, it is evident that, depending on the system parameters and load characteristics, good performance can be obtained with this system configuration. Based on non-linear dynamic modelling and experimental results, the transient instants when cavitation or high pressure peaks can occur are determined. Subsequently, a set of equations establishing the relationship between the valve control orifice ratio and cylinder area ratio are derived.

The on/off solenoid valves utilized on many of these systems can significantly affect the performance. Various factors can affect the speed of the valves causing them to experience various delays, which impact the overall performance of hydraulic systems. This work presents the development of an adaptive statistical based thresholding real-time valve delay model for digital Pump/Motors. The proposed method actively measures the valve delays in real-time and adapts the threshold of the system with the goal of improving the overall efficiency and performance of the system. This work builds on previous work by evaluating an alternative method used to detect valve delays in real-time. The method used here is a shift detection method for the pressure signals that utilizes domain knowledge and the system’s historical statistical behavior. This allows the model to be used over a large range of operating conditions, since the model can learn patterns and adapt to various operating conditions using domain knowledge and statistical behavior. A hydraulic circuit was built to measure the delay time experienced from the time the signal is sent to the valve to the time that the valve opens. Experiments were conducted on a three piston in-line digital pump/motor with 2 valves per cylinder, at low and high pressure ports, for a total of six valves. Two high frequency pressure transducers were used in this circuit to measure and analyze the differential pressure on the low and high pressure side of the on/off valves, as well as three in-cylinder pressure transducers. Data over 60 cycles was acquired to analyze the model against real time valve delays. The results show that the algorithm was successful in adapting the threshold for real time valve delays and accurately measuring the valve delays.&nbsp;",https://journals.riverpublishers.com/index.php/IJFP/article/view/301,"['Digital Pump Motor', 'Digital Hydraulics', 'Fluid Power', 'Valve Timing', 'Valve']"

The kinematics and statics model of the joint was established by the piecewise constant curvature (PCC) method, and the model was proved to be effective. The silicone staging pouring process was used in the manufacture of joints and fingers, which can achieve high-quality product rates. A soft finger actuator composed of three soft joints was designed and manufactured, whose length was 1.3 times the human finger.

Quasi-static behaviour analysis is applied to three distinct load sensing systems: the meter-in pressure compensation system (MIPCS), meterout pressure compensation system (MOPCS), and pressure compensation load sensing system (PCLSS). The energy usage equation shows that minimising pump supply pressure is the only way to ensure high energy saving efficiency; proper opening modes between the meter-in and meter-out orifices of the MIPCS and MOPCS are also obtained by deducing and analysing appropriate equations. Systems parameters are then kept constant as the pump supply pressure of the three systems are compared by varying the external force. Comparison results show that the pump supply pressure of both the MIPCS and MOPCS are lower than that of PCLSS, and that the optimal metering pressure compensation method is dependent on the working mode.

Reducing the response times–i.e., returning as many solutions as early as possible– is important in particular in Web-based client-server query processing scenarios in which network latencies dominate query execution times. Such scenarios are typical in the context of integration of Web data sources where a data integration component executes queries over a decentralized federation of such data sources.

We show fundamental properties of this operator and observe that the downside of achieving the desired monotonicity property is a potentially significant increase in query result sizes.

In this contribution it is analyzed in which cases the application of electro-mechanical actuators can be of advantage and why displacement-controlled systems may be one of these applications. A novel electromechanical valve actuation system for large sized 4/3-way directional control valves for the use in displacement-controlled systems is presented. This new actuation system is characterized by a hydraulic relief of the centering springs. Therefore, the springs are only active in safety-critical conditions, such as a power outage. Since the actuator is not working against the spring force during every displacement, the necessary actuation force is reduced drastically. Thus, common electromechanical actuators can be used. In case of a power outage, the spring relief is deactivated causing the stored energy to center the spool in its neutral position.

Energy is stored in the flywheel-accumulator by compressing a gas, increasing the moment of inertia of the flywheel by adding hydraulic fluid, and by increasing the angular velocity of the flywheel. Through a numerical model of the energy flows in the system, the energy storage of the flywheel-accumulator was demonstrated to be approximately 10 times greater than a conventional accumulator. Furthermore, the flywheel-accumulator allows the hydraulic system pressure to be independent of the quantity of energy stored.

However, the classical approach to the modelling of servo-hydraulic actuators is based on the hypothesis that the flow through the servovalve orifices is turbulent, and this assumption can lead to significant errors if the dynamics of actuators operating in extreme conditions is concerned. This is the case of aerospace applications, since flight actuators can be commanded to move against high counteracting loads or at very low velocities, and a laminar (or rather “mixed”) flow pattern can be established in the servovalve orifices. In the paper, the flow through the Moog D633 four-way servovalve is studied by means of experiments and Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations (developed in the STAR-CD environment). Two are the basic objectives of the investigation: to characterise the laminar-to-turbulent flow transition in the orifices of an aircraft-type hydraulic component, providing an original physical interpretation to the increase of the orifice discharge efficiency in “mixed” flow conditions, and to highlight the necessity of using Reynolds-dependant orifice equations for the modelling of high-performance servo-hydraulic actuators.",https://journals.riverpublishers.com/index.php/IJFP/article/view/541,"['orifice flow', 'CFD analysis', 'experiments on hydraulic fluids', 'laminar-to-turbulent transition', 'electro-hydraulic servovalve']"

This results in more complex energy management strategies being derived.

Hydraulic positioning systems are used in many different applications, such as mobile machinery, industry and aerospace. In aircraft, the hydraulic actuators are used at flight control surfaces, cargo doors, steering, landing gear and so one. However, the massive use of resistive control techniques, which throttles the passages of the hydraulic fluid, associated with internal leakage of the hydraulic components, make these systems low energy efficient. In order to improve their energy efficiency, digital hydraulics emerges as a promising solution mainly for mobile applications. In this paper a hydraulic positioning system for aircraft control surfaces using a multi-chamber actuator controlled by on/off valves and a digital pump is proposed. The use of a digital pump with three fixed displacement pumps can provide eight different volumetric displacement outputs. The multi-chamber actuator with four areas can operate in two different modes, normal or regenerative, resulting in six different equivalent areas. The regenerative mode allows the actuator to achieve higher actuation velocity values with smaller pumps. These equivalent areas combined with the different supplied flow rates can deliver 43 different discrete output velocity values for the actuator, in steady-state. For the system dynamic analyses, three mathematical simulation models were developed using MATLAB/Simulink and Hopsan, one for the digital system, and two for the conventional solutions applied in aircraft (Servo Hydraulic Actuators (SHA) and Electro Hydrostatic Actuator (EHA)). The simulation results demonstrate that the digital actuator can achieve, for position control, a maximum position error, in a steady-state, of 0.7 mm. From the energy consumption point of view, the digital circuit consumes 31 times less energy when compared with the SHA and 1.7 when compared to the EHA, resulting in an energy efficiency of 54%.",https://journals.riverpublishers.com/index.php/IJFP/article/view/19655,"['Digital hydraulics', 'multi-chamber actuators', 'digital pumps', 'position control']"

From different studies emerged that in the specific field of ICE Off-road Vehicles, only about 10–15% of the available power at fuel level is actually transformed into useful energy for the actuators. Particularly the losses in the Directional Control Valves represent about 35–40% of the hydraulic energy available at the pump level. The traditional Directional Control Valves design solutions, in fact, neglects important opportunities for reducing losses and improving internal regeneration.

The device is configured such that the transduction from thermal energy to stored energy, in the form of compressed gas, is efficient relative to other smallscale portable power supply systems. This efficiency is achieved by matching the dynamic load of the compressor to the ideal adiabatic expansion of the hot gas combustion products. It is shown that a load that is dominantly inertial provides a nearly ideally matched load for achieving high thermodynamic efficiency in a heat engine.

The overall efficiency model is then obtained by multiplying the volumetric and the mechanical efficiency equations. In this paper, we show that the overall efficiency equations must be developed from an energy balance and show that the simple multiplication of mechanical and volumetric efficiencies can potentially lead to inaccurate results.

Observable differences in drain flow were shown, and machine learning algorithms were able to successfully classify a faulty and healthy pump with accuracies nearing 100%.

This paper presents and analyzes schemes for controlling pump pressure designed for coordinated haptic control. Typical of many small backhoes and excavators, the hydraulic system used on the test-bed is comprised of a constant displacement pump and proportional directional control valves. In this type of system, a main pressure regulator is needed to supply the other closed-centre valves with pressure and to dump the additional flow generated by the pump to tank. An energy-saving solution has a load-sensing pressure regulator that maintains the system pressure to a preset margin above the highest active load pressure. Using these valves for haptic applications requires closed-loop control. Applying closed-loop control to these valves can excite instabilities in the valve assembly due to complex interactions and nonlinearities in the load-sensing pressure regulator and proportional valves. On this setup, the hydro-mechanical pressure regulator has been replaced with one that is electronically controlled, and a non-linear filter is utilized to decouple oscillations in port pressure from the pump pressure input signal.

This work examines the effects of the peak-and-hold and reverse current driving strategies on the performance of two commercially available direct actuated valves, and the resulting impact on the efficiency of a digital pump/motor. An electric circuit was designed to execute the driving strategies and a single valve hydraulic test stand was assembled to perform the valve timing studies. The differential pressure across the valves was found by installing the valves between two high frequency pressure transducers, allowing the calculation of the transition and delay time of the valves. The durations of the peak and reverse voltage signals were varied over a range of 0–10 ms with a 1 ms increment. Peak voltages were between 50 and 55 V, followed by a holding voltage of 12 V. The optimum response was found at peak duration of 6–8 ms. A reverse current strategy was used to increase the decay rate of the eddy currents during a turn-off response, improving the response time.

The energy-saving approaches are classified into four categories: hybridization, control algorithms, waste energy recovery and reduction of energy losses. Also, the sub-categories of each strategy are discussed individually in brief. The energy efficiency can go up to 69% using a hybridization strategy, whereas using a fuel-saving strategy is within the range of 20–40%. Another strategy, i.e., control algorithms, yields 40% of fuel savings on the displacement-controlled excavator system. Similarly, the maximum potential to recover the braking energy is about 78% in the case of the Constant Pressure System (CPS) system using flywheel under the category of waste energy recovery. Moreover, 56–66.1% throttling energy saving potential is observed on an On/Off high-speed valve-controlled hydraulic system under the reduction of energy loss strategy.

A model is proposed that considers the flow as a mix of laminar and turbulent flow and flow forceswith a flow angle that varies with the stroke of the spool. The model shows good agreement with measurements. The investigations show that the flow forces decrease with higher flow rates as a result of a flow angle that tends to go towards a vertical angle.

However, since several parameters can influence the spool stability, parametric studies become significantly computationally expensive and graphical analysis of the numerical results in multidimensional parameter space becomes difficult. 
To overcome this difficulty, in this work, an analytical approach for studying the stability characteristics of the spool valve is presented. A Rayleigh-Ritz method is used for solving the Reynolds equation in an approximate way in order to determine an analytical expression for the lateral force on the sealing lands. This analytical expression allows stability analysis of the spool via analytical means which finally results in the expression of critical axial velocity which demarcates the regions of stable behaviour. Simplicity of the expression allows an immediate insight into the role of design parameters in the stability of the spool.

Consequently, vehicle dynamics are underdamped, and operators experience vibrations of low frequency and high amplitude which are detrimental to health, comfort and productivity. For most vehicles, the state of the art for improving ride quality is passive energy dissipation via seat dampers and hydraulic accumulators connected in parallel to the actuators. Alternatively, ride quality may be enhanced by active control of the seat or working actuators. In the present work, active vibration damping is considered for a skid-steer loader based on control of the flow rate to the boom lift cylinders with a variable displacement pump. A four degrees of freedom vehicle dynamic model is derived for linear motion in the vertical and horizontal directions, pitching angle, and boom motion with respect to the chassis. Dynamics of the hydraulic pump and actuator are also modelled. Considering the requirements of the intended application, the feedback control design emphasizes simplicity of implementation. The control law is a multi-DOF version of the well-known “skyhook damper” principle, where the control force is proportional to the vehicle velocity. Cascaded feedback loops of pump displacement and pressure produce the required force. An experimental evaluation was conducted according to ISO 2631-1 (1997) to measure the effect of the active controller on whole-body vibration as perceived by the operator. The active damping system reduced total vibration by as much as 34% and was consistently superior to a commercially available passive damping solution.

It is demonstrated in this paper that if the optimal accumulator state trajectory is known, then an implementable control scheme can achieve near globally optimal fuel efficiency. Controller development began by optimally controlling a series hybrid over a representative drive cycle using Dynamic Programming (DP). A Neural Network (NN) was then trained to reproduce the DP optimal accumulator pressure trajectory based on the vehicle’s velocity over the previous thirty seconds. In this way the NN generalized the relationship between vehicle velocity and accumulator pressure. The NN power management controller’s performance was then evaluated on a hardware-in-the-loop transmission dynamometer using untrained drive cycles to demonstrate the generality of the proposed approach.

In the following years DD machines were progressively developed.

This counter principle is based on hydraulically actuated switching valves which have a hysteretic response with respect to the pilot pressure. Manufacturing tolerances of the tiny components caused unexpected high leakage which, in turn, led to a malfunction of the system.
In this paper a new sealing concept, is introduced to solve this problem. It is based on a non-contact seal (sealing gap), which exploits a self-regulating, elasto-hydrodynamic effect to reduce a rather large initial gap h0 – to allow a rough tolerance – into a very small sealing gap h(x) to avoid dry friction of valve spool movement on the one hand but have very small leakage on the other hand.
As sealing, an annular flexible ring made, e.g. of PTFE, is used which combines sufficient flexibility to allow this self adapting mechanism to a sufficient extent and to stay the high pressure loads.
For the mathematical analysis of the concept, an approximate elasto-hydrodynamic analytical model is used. It sets the gap pressure, obtained from the Reynold’s equation for the sealing gap, the elastic restoring forces of the sealing ring, and the imparting pressure in equilibrium.
The sealing concept is then simulated with a numerical model built with the finite element code ABAQUS, this results are compared with the one of the analytical model.
It solves the Reynolds equation by a user defined subroutine. The simulation results indicate that this sealing principle delivers way better results than standard gap seals despite its rough manufacturing tolerances with one order of magnitude higher tolerance ranges.

The corresponding research results show that fluid friction is limited to small dynamic boundary layers whereas the remaining fluid domain exhibits practically no friction effect and has bulk flow characteristics. An explanation how this boundary layer transfers its dissipative effect to the bulk flow has been given by Gittler et al. using asymptotic expansion techniques. They found that the effect of the boundary layer on the bulk flow in the centre is given by radial velocity components. The authors have shown that the findings of Gittler et al. are generally valid in the 3D case exploiting matched asymptotic expansions. In this paper these results are developed further to exploit this dynamical boundary layer theory for an efficient Finite Element (FE) computation of viscid waves. Standard acoustic elements without viscosity as available in many FE codes combined with frequency dependent acoustic boundary conditions can be used to simulate 3D viscid wave propagation in frequency domain.

In the current paper, a two-phase volume of fluid (VOF) methodology combined with Schnerr-Sauer cavitation model is employed to perform quasi-direct transient fully three-dimensional calculations of the cavitating jet inside a poppet valve, with special concern on the laminar-turbulent transition. The numerical results allow separate examination of several distinctive flow characteristics, which show agreeable consistency with experimental observation. The periodic evolution of cavitation structure is related to temporal development of large-scale structure. The potential core indicated by velocity distribution, however, assumes a similar flow pattern regardless of temporal evolution of large-scale eddy. According to the different flow characteristics, the transitional process is divided into several parts, including laminar part, waving fluctuation, cross-linked vortex segments and cloud of cavitating vortexes. A comprehensive discussion on the transition is performed based on the numerical results, with primary concern on the governing mechanisms, including the formation of coherent structure organized as paired vortex, development of instability together with its effects on the coherent structure, and interaction between the vortexes. The streamwise vorticity strength accounts for less than 10% of the total vorticity in the cross-link region. It reveals that the breakdown of paired coherent structure is a result of the successive pairing process generated from combination of longitudinal and circumferential perturbation, instead of the growth of streamwise vortices as in the case of submerged circular jet.",https://journals.riverpublishers.com/index.php/IJFP/article/view/911,"['cavitation', 'poppet valve', 'laminar-turbulent transition', 'pairing process', 'paired structure']"

A lumped parameter model was developed for the transmission line, assuming different number of lumps, considering the effect of line resistance, inertia and capacitance. The validity of lumped parameter models is evaluated by comparing theoretical results with published experimental results.

Crucial components of hydraulic exoskeletons concerning this weight aspect are hydraulic valves and particularly their actuators, since conventional solenoids contribute the lion share of valve size and weight. As one option to solve this weight and size problem the application of smart materials such as piezo-ceramics to electrically actuate hydraulic valves are seen.

To overcome the problem of very low strain of the piezo a mechanism for amplification via a bistable buckling beam is analyzed analytically and numerically and an actuator prototype is designed and manufactured.

Resistive control is a major source of energy losses in valve-controlled systems that share the same pump to drive multiple loads. By combining different chambers, the load on multi-chamber actuators can be transformed into different pressure and flow rate levels. This allows the adaptation of its load to the loads on other actuators. This can lead to a reduction of resistive control energy losses that occur between pump and actuators when driven simultaneously. As a case study to highlight how the system efficiency can be improved, a load sensing system with a conventional and a multi-chamber actuator is analysed. The equations that describe the system steady state behaviour are presented to evaluate the effect of the load transformations on the system efficiency. A disadvantage of such architecture is the fact that load transformations result in different actuator speeds. To reduce this effect, a compensation factor for the command signal to the proportional valve is presented. The highlight from this paper is the potential for efficiency improvement enabled by the adoption of multi-chamber actuators in a valve-controlled architecture.

Finally the nonlinear model is used to produce Bode magnitude plots at various pressure drops in order to estimate the system bandwidth. Results indicate that increasing the size of the orifice at the inlet of the pilot stage of the valve increases performance in terms of rise time at the cost of a more oscillatory response. High pressure differences between the inlet and outlet of the valve were found to cause performance to increase significantly as well as move poles into a region indicated less damping.

The efficacy of the numerical procedure is compared with two other available methods, namely small-signal analysis and Golubev’s least-squares approach. It is shown that the proposed approach can describe large signal effects and at the same time properly characterize the features of the hydraulic actuator frequency response that are important for robust control design, without the need for a priori information about the asymptotic behaviour or structure of the equivalent LTI transfer function.

The suitability of the test procedure as a standard method for assessment of the inherent source pulsation power of a hydraulic pump is confirmed. First, it was determined that the pulsation power in a pipeline can be measured using a pressure sensor unit called the “pulsation intensity probe”, which utilizes the same measurement principle as a conventional “sound intensity probe”, with good repeatability and with sufficient accuracy for practical usage. Next, a standard test procedure for determining the inherent source pulsation power of a hydraulic pump, which is independent of the hydraulic circuit, from the measurements of a pulsation power in a reference pipe was proposed. Finally, it was verified from the experimental measurements and simulations that this proposed standard test method is very useful for both absolute and relative assessments of the level of source pulsation power of a hydraulic pump.",https://journals.riverpublishers.com/index.php/IJFP/article/view/504,"['hydraulic pump', 'fluid-borne vibration', 'pressure pulsation', 'pulsation power', 'standard test method']"

A preliminary survey of proposed designs based on traditional motion simulation platform configurations (Stewart Platforms) required hydraulic power supplies approaching 1.22 MW. This manuscript describes the combined design and control effort that led to a system with the same performance requirements, however requiring a primary power supply that was less than 100 kW.

Decoupling of meter in from meter out provides for more controllability and potential for energy saving in overrunning load cases when compared with a conventional spool valve controlled hydraulic system. A four-valve configuration controlling a hydraulic cylinder is emphasized in this paper. The four-valve configuration can operate in several two-valve discrete modes because each of the four valves is controlled separately from the others. Five distinct (or discrete) metering modes that exist in the literature are initially studied: Powered Extension, High Side Regeneration Extension, Low Side Regeneration Extension, Powered Retraction, and Low Side Regeneration retraction. Each of these modes has different force and speed capabilities and the operating mode should consequently be selected based on the load and the commanded speed. Proper switching between these modes is crucial for efficient and productive performance.
The problem of switching between these five modes is treated as an optimal control problem of a switched dynamic system. General theory for the optimal control problem is derived and then applied to the hydraulic system of interest. The results are then interpreted and explained by looking into the force-speed capability of modes, and a closed form solution for the quasi static case is presented.",https://journals.riverpublishers.com/index.php/IJFP/article/view/531,"['hydraulics', 'independent metering valves', 'metering modes', 'mode capability curve', 'mode switching']"

With Professors Andrew Plummer and Kevin Edge, both of Bath, and Chris Buxton of the British Fluid Power Association.
For many years Professor Cliff Burrows was one of the father figures of our fluid power research community. He helped to found the FPCE (Fluid Power Centres of Europe) in the 1990’s as a network of leading fluid power research institutes. The FPCE was one of the two groups which merged to form the Global Fluid Power Society in 2016, the hosting organisation of this Journal. Cliff had broad interests in the dynamics and control of machine systems, and had a particular interest in fluid power going back to research on servopneumatics in the 1960’s.
Cliff came from a poor background. His mother had been in service and his father worked on the railways. He secured a scholarship to read Engineering at Swansea University where he also met his future wife, Margaret. According to his family, he did a second engineering degree (in London) and then some further research to avoid National Service!
His academic career started at Sussex University, and got his first Chair in Glasgow as Head of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Strathclyde. Cliff joined the University of Bath in 1987 as Professor of Systems Engineering and Director of the Fluid Power Centre (subsequently re-named the Centre for Power Transmission &amp; Motion Control). In 1988, he inaugurated what is now the annual Bath/ASME Symposium on Fluid Power &amp; Motion Control and was co-editor of its Proceedings until 2005. He was also cofounder and editor of the IMechE Proceedings Part I, Journal of Systems and Control Engineering. Cliff served as Head of the School of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Bath between 1990 and 1995, and as the Dean of the Faculty of Engineering for a period of five years.
His contributions were recognised by, amongst other things: the award of a DSc in 1987; the award of the IMechE Bramah Medal in 1993; election to the Fellowship of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 1998; award of honorary doctorates from RWTH, Aachen, and the University of Aston in 2000 and 2001, respectively; and the award of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Robert E Koski Medal in 2008. His lifetime achievements were further recognised by the award of an OBE in 2005 for services to Higher Education and to Engineering. One of his proudest days was at Buckingham Palace receiving his honour from her Majesty the Queen.
He was devoted to his wife Margaret, who passed away last October, and is survived by their four children and many grandchildren. Many of us will remember Cliff as someone with a great sense of humour, and while constantly ribbing others, had the grace to enjoy a joke at his own expense. He will be missed.

Unlike a traditional lumped-parameter approach, the accuracy of the fluid resonant frequencies predicted by the proposed models is precise and not a function of transmission line axial discretisation. Therefore, model order (complexity) is solely a function of the number of desired modes, which in turn influences pressure and flow predictions. The results are applicable to both laminar and turbulent flow. To develop the models, a distributed lumpedparameter approach is employed. Specifically, a quasi-steady state friction approximation is used within the governing partial differential equations. The solution to the linearised ordinary differential equations produces three transcendent transfer functions that are approximated using finite-order rational transfer functions.

By filling the chamber between the two layers with pressurised air, one obtains a low-weight, high-power pneumatic actuator at very low cost. The paper first describes the design, fabrication and properties of PTAs in general. Then, the characteristics of a specific PTA are determined experimentally. Moreover, we derive a mathematical model of the dynamic behaviour of the PTA. The model forms the basis for a motion control algorithm, combining flatness-based feedforward and linear feedback control. Finally, the performance of the controller is evaluated experimentally. The results indicate that PTAs are well suited for motion control tasks requiring small displacements but high forces and minimum actuator weight.

The variable flow gain reduces the performance of a strictly derived nonlinear controller. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the nonlinearity of flow gain in the controller design. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes an adaptive robust controller for a hydraulic manipulator with a flow-mapping compensator, which takes into account the nonlinear flow gain and improves the performance of the nonlinear controller.

The element taken as reference is a two-way priority spool valve, typically utilized in steering systems with a load sensing control strategy in the presence of other actuators. The valve’s purpose is to control the primary port flow rate, the exceeding flow being discharged to the secondary output port. The optimization algorithm is based on Response Surface Methodology techniques, adopting the path search method known as Steepest Descent. For this purpose, the component’s behaviour is analytically described by means of a properly defined objective function. The procedure approximates this objective function with a simple model whose coefficients are evaluated using an AMESim® model of the valve, previously verified using test results. The simulations required to find the fitting model are planned using Design Of Experiments (DOE) methods. Because of the large number of factors characterizing valve design a preliminary analysis (screening) based on DOE algorithms was performed in order to identify the parameters which significantly influence valve behaviour. This allows the important factors to be considered for the optimization phase. The entire numerical procedure was implemented through MATLAB® scripts which automatically execute the AMESIM® simulations to perform the screening analysis or optimization. Considering a configuration pertinent to a stock version of the valve as starting point of the procedure, the paper proposes an optimal configuration. Experimental investigations performed on a prototype reveal the improved performance achieved with the proposed design in comparison with the behaviour observed in different stock versions of the valve, highlighting the potential of the optimization procedure developed.

The model in this paper assumes that small air bubbles are entrapped between the contact areas of the asperity peaks and that the fluid film flow between the cavitation bubbles is guided by Reynolds equation. The proposed model exhibits high sensitivity to initial bubble size and initial contact force compared to state-of-the art models.

The considered model is mainly comprised of four other subsystems: a machine system, a hydraulic system, a trajectory control system and a sensor system. Moreover, a fuzzy neural network (FNN) PID strategy is introduced to the trajectory control system to guarantee the accuracy of automatic operation. On the basis of the multi-domain physical model, typical simulation experiments for working patterns were performed to validate the performance of the FNNPID controller.

A comparison was performed between five different (Physical Vapor Deposition) PVD-coated vane tips and the normal vane without coating.

The results show that the effect of the vane force and the pressure difference between the two sides of the vane are very small compared to the relative speed.

In this paper, the most commonly used gait trot is selected as the research object. First, the multi-rigid motion equation of the quadruped robot is established by the spin recursion method based on Lie groups. Next, the Lagrange multiplier is used to represent the constraint force to establish the 12-degree-of-freedom inverse dynamics model of the quadruped robot’s stance phase. And the hybrid dynamics method is used to reduce the dimension of the inversion matrix, which simplifies the solution process of the dynamics model. Then, the trajectory of the foot is planned. Through the analysis of the simplified model, it is concluded that the gait cycle and the initial position of the stance phase are important factors affecting the stability of the trot gait. Finally, the controller framework of the quadruped robot is introduced, and the effectiveness of the algorithm designed in this paper is verified through the co-simulation of the trot gait.

Although this scheme is characterized by a small package size and low energy consumption, it is influenced by higher pressure peaks and larger transient uncertainty than are other coding schemes, e.g., Fibonacci coding and pulse number modulation, consequently resulting in poor tracking accuracy.
This issue can be solved by introducing a delay in the signal opening/ closing of the previous or subsequent valve, thus providing sufficient time for state alteration and valve processes. In a metering-in velocity control circuit, a feedforward neural network controller was used to create artificial delays according to the pressure difference over the digital flow control unit (DFCU) valves. The delayed signal samples fed to the controller were acquired through the genetic algorithm method, and the analysis was performed with MATLAB software.",https://journals.riverpublishers.com/index.php/IJFP/article/view/344,"['digital hydraulics, speed control', 'pulse code modulation', 'pressure peaks', 'neural network.']"

A discussion on the employed experimental methodology is included along with the validation of this model. When the pressure differential across the valve is sufficiently high and does not vary considerably, the model for this valve can be simplified substantially. More specifically, the EHPV can be modelled as a linear second order system with a static input nonlinearity. This nonlinearity is realized from the valve’s steady state characteristics. The advantage of this separation between valve dynamics and nonlinearities is that an inverse linearisation approach (to cancel the nonlinearity) can be used to facilitate the control task for the valve.",https://journals.riverpublishers.com/index.php/IJFP/article/view/502,"['nonlinear model', 'proportional control valve', 'poppet valves', 'bidirectional valve', 'flow conductance factor']"

In the present study, the effect of grooves cut on the piston surface, the number of the grooves and their location over the piston surface on the volumetric efficiency of the hydraulic radial piston pumps was investigated. In order to perform the research tests, the three-piston fixed displacement pump with seven configurations was firstly designed and fabricated. The output flow rate of the pump was determined at pressure outlets of 350 and 500 bar and then the volumetric efficiency was calculated as the mean values of measured data. The results showed that the grooves cut on the piston surface produces a higher piston–cylinder overall leakage and then tend to reduce the volumetric efficiency. Also as the number of grooves being cut on piston surface increases, an increase in leakage will happen. In addition, by increasing the outlet pressure from 350 to 500 bar, the volumetric efficiency decreased significantly for the pumps with higher number of grooves cut. Among the configurations studied, pump with one groove at the inner edge at second groove position is the one bringing the best performance because of the minimum reduction in the volumetric efficiency between grooved piston pumps and producing higher restoring torque at all pump configurations according to previous literature.",https://journals.riverpublishers.com/index.php/IJFP/article/view/151,"['performance', 'groove', 'volumetric efficiency', 'Radial hydraulic piston pump']"
